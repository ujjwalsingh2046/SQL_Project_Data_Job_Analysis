# ðŸ’¼ SQL Project: Job Market Analysis for Data Roles

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing job market data related to **data analyst, data engineer, and data scientist** roles using SQL. The primary goal is to extract meaningful insights about top-paying jobs, most demanded skills, and optimal skill combinations that are in demand in todayâ€™s competitive job market.

---

## ðŸ§  Background
With the rapid growth in the field of data, job seekers often face confusion regarding:
- Which roles pay the best?
- What skills are most in demand?
- How do specific skills relate to high salaries?

This analysis helps demystify these questions using actual job postings and structured relational data. All queries are designed to simulate real-world business questions that a data analyst might answer.

---

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies Used
- **SQL** (PostgreSQL) â€“ for data querying and analysis
- **VS Code** â€“ for writing and organizing SQL scripts
- **Git & GitHub** â€“ for version control and project hosting
- **Git LFS** â€“ to handle large CSV files over 100MB

---

## ðŸ“Š The Analysis

The analysis is broken down into structured queries:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `1_top_paying_jobs.sql` | Finds the top-paying data-related job titles |
| `2_top_paying_job_skills.sql` | Reveals the highest-paying jobs and their required skills |
| `3_top_demanded_skill.sql` | Identifies the most demanded individual skills |
| `4_top_paying_skills.sql` | Shows which specific skills are most associated with high salaries |
| `5_optimal_skils.sql` | Suggests the best skill combinations to learn for maximizing salary potential |

These queries use `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, and aggregate functions like `AVG()` to derive insights from the provided relational schema.

## ðŸ“š What I Learned

- How to work with **relational datasets** and write **optimized SQL queries** for business insights.
- How to structure and modularize SQL projects for scalability and reuse.
- Real-world application of **joins, subqueries**, and **data grouping** techniques.
- Managing **large datasets on GitHub** using **Git LFS**.

---

## ðŸ§¾ Conclusion

This project gave me a deeper understanding of how SQL is used to derive actionable insights from real-world job data. I now feel more confident in writing queries that mirror business problems and help stakeholders make informed decisions.

---

## ðŸ”® Future Aspects

In the future, I plan to:
- **Visualize these insights** using **Power BI** or **Tableau**
- Build a **dashboard** showing real-time trends in the job market
- Add **Python scripts** for preprocessing or automation
- Include **resume keyword optimization** based on skills in demand

This is just the beginning of a more advanced data analytics portfolio. ðŸš€
